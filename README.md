# KotlinToolBox
Android Studio Kotlin ToolBox
This project is designed to learn Kotlin using Android Studio.
Most Tutorials teaching Kotlin Use a simple IDE (NetBeans or InteliJ). I am developing this App called KotlinToolbox to learn
the Kotlin language and Android development together on the Android Studio IDE. The App is a ListView that represents drawers in a
"ToolBox" when a drawer is opened an Activity is launched which contains Kotlin examples that actualy work on an android device.
